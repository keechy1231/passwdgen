Simple Bash script that you can use to create wordlists for bruteforcing

Default function:

Runs a crunch command that accepts three arguments, 'WORD' 'YEAR' 'Additional Years'

Example:

./passwdgen.sh Spring 2022 5

This will make a wordlist with iterations of Spring2022^ (^ will add different symbols in the crunch command) 
The scipt will then complete the same crunch command for 5 more years. 

Made for use on the PNPT exam based of Heaths teaching methods for simple password guessing that should be attempted.
